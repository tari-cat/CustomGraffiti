## Custom Graffiti
This mod adds custom graffiti in BRC by simply adding images to folders. <br/>
The mod supports **.jpg** and **.png** files.

### How to add Graffiti
In the mod folder there's a `CustomGraffiti` folder. (This can be found in your mod manager as the "Browse data folder" option.) <br/>
In the `CustomGraffiti` folder, you can place your images into four different folders (`Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, and `ExtraLarge`), which change the size of your graffiti. <br/>

`Small` graffiti will be randomized by default and do not require a combo. <br/>

For `Medium`, `Large`, and `ExtraLarge` graffiti, the **file name needs to start with your desired combo**. <br/>

The file format for graffiti is as follows where `XXXXXX` is your desired combo in **unique** numbers: <br/>
`Medium`: `XXXX_Name.png` <br/>
`Large`: `XXXXX_Name.png` <br/>
`ExtraLarge`: `XXXXXX_Name.png` <br/>

For example: `162534_My Graffiti.png`

Please note that the underscore between your combo and graffiti name is required for `Medium`, `Large`, and `ExtraLarge` Graffiti! <br/>
Avoid using duplicate names as well. <br/>
Custom graffiti will override the original graffiti in the base game. Custom graffiti with duplicate combos will be randomized.

### Known Issues
**Removed custom graffiti will render as a gray/white square**. <br/>
While this mod is SlopCrew/Multiplayer safe -- **tricks have no multiplier for new custom graffiti**. <br/>
